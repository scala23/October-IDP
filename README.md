# October IDP

Goal: My goal for this project is to make a way users can click and draw on the canvas and make a unique drawing every time with multiple dimensions. Furthermore, I want users to be able to clear the drawing and change the background with just one key. 

October 10: Made the replit for my October IDP. 

October 18: Laid out the basic colorlist and background setup for the project. 

October 19: Laid the variables I wanted to use for the lines out. 

October 24: Created a draw function for the lines I wanted to create. Made a map function for where the lines were going to go. Filled the lines with ellipses. Code currently does not work.

October 25: Fixed issue in map function which caused ntohing to be drawn. 

October 27: Added a new colorlist to change the background color and erase whatever is drawn. 

October 28: Changed the size of each ellipse being drawn to 1 so the image drawn would be more transparent. Also changed the amount of ellipses drawn.

October 29: Changed some elements to variables for more streamlined code. 

October 31: Turned in final project
